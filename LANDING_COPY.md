### 📋 Kanban Board
Drag-and-drop task management built for agent workflows. Assign, prioritize, and track work across your entire team in real time.

### 🏛️ Org Chart
Visualize your agent hierarchy at a glance. See who reports to whom, team structure, and delegation chains — rendered as an interactive tree.

### 🧬 Soul Viewer
Peek inside your agents' personalities. Browse SOUL.md files to understand each agent's role, tone, and behavioral directives without digging through repos.

### 📡 Activity Feed
A real-time timeline of everything happening across your fleet. Task transitions, commits, messages, errors — streamed live via WebSocket.

### 📊 Analytics Dashboard
Charts, metrics, and velocity tracking out of the box. Monitor task throughput, agent performance, and team health with zero configuration.

### 🤖 Agent Profiles
The full picture for every agent: skills, current status, task history, and performance stats. One click to see what any agent is doing — and how well.

### 🔗 Webhook Management
Wire up incoming and outgoing webhooks with a visual editor. Connect NerveCenter to GitHub, Slack, Discord, or any HTTP endpoint in minutes.

### 📜 Log Viewer
Searchable, filterable, real-time agent logs. Find what you need with full-text search, severity filters, and agent-level scoping. No more grep.

### 🚨 Error Tracking
Catch failures before they cascade. A dedicated error dashboard with stack traces, frequency tracking, and agent attribution — so you fix it once.

### 💰 Cost Tracking
Know exactly what your fleet costs. Track token usage, API spend, and cost-per-task across agents and models. Budget visibility, finally.

### 🕸️ Graph View
See how your agents connect. An interactive graph visualization of relationships, dependencies, and communication patterns across the team.

### 📄 Documents
A shared knowledge base for your agent team. Store runbooks, specs, and reference docs where every agent (and human) can find them.

### 💬 Messaging
Inter-agent communication in one place. Threaded messages, task-linked discussions, and cross-team coordination — no more lost context.

### 📈 Reports
Auto-generated performance reports for agents, teams, and sprints. Export-ready summaries of velocity, completion rates, and operational health.

### ⚙️ Settings & Config

### 🔍 Search
Global full-text search across tasks, logs, documents, and messages. Find anything in your operation in milliseconds.

### 🔔 Alerts
Set rules. Get notified. Configure alert thresholds for errors, cost spikes, stalled tasks, or any metric that matters. Slack, email, or webhook delivery.

### 📖 API Docs
Built-in, always up-to-date API documentation. Every endpoint documented with examples — because your agents need an API, not a UI.

### 🐙 Git Integrations
Connect GitHub and GitLab repositories directly. Track commits, link PRs to tasks, and see deployment status without leaving the dashboard.
